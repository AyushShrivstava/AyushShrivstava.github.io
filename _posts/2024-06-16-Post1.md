This blogpost is written for myself as I keep forgetting the steps to set up a conda environment for my ML projects.

Install Conda
-------------
These four commands quickly and quietly install the latest 64-bit version of the installer and then clean up after themselves. To install a different version or architecture of Miniconda for Linux, change the name of the `.sh` installer in the `wget` command.

Visit the [Miniconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/) to find the latest version of Miniconda for Linux.


```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```

After installing, initialize your newly-installed Miniconda. The following commands initialize for bash and zsh shells:

```bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
```
you can run `conda -V` to check if conda is installed correctly. 

Creating Conda Environment
--------------------------

The below command will create the conda environment with the name `EnvName` and python version 3.9.

```bash
conda create --name EnvName python=3.9 jupyter
```

To activate the environment, run the below command:

```bash
conda activate EnvName
```

Installing Pytorch
------------------

Visit the [Pytorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to find the latest version of Pytorch. You can choose your system configuration and get the command to install Pytorch.

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

check if everything is installed correctly by running the below command:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
```

Installing other libraries and packages.
