    "# Optical Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movement of object or camera. It is vector field where each vector denotes the movement of points from first frame to second. Generally, optical flow is used to track the motion of objects in a video. Lets assume you have captured two frames with a small time difference $\\Delta t$. You wish to track the motion of a pixel located at $(x, y)$ in first frame. In the second frame, the pixel has moved to $(x + \\Delta x, y + \\Delta y)$. The vector $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$ is the optical flow vector. \n",

    "The above equation is called optical flow equation. It is a single equation with two unknowns $u$ and $v$. Hence, it is an ill-posed problem. To solve this problem, we need to make some more assumptions. One of the assumption to arrive here was brightness constancy assumption. It assumes that the intensity of an object does not change between two consecutive frames. The other assumption made was given by lucas and kanade. They assumed that the optical flow is same for all the pixels in a neighborhood. This assumption is called spatial coherence assumption.\n",
